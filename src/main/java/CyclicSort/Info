Yes, you're right. The typical assumption for cyclic 
sort is that the elements in the array range from 
1 to n, where n is the size of the array. This means each element
 represents its correct position in the sorted array.

 In cyclic sort, the "correct position" for an element at index i is indeed where the element with the value of arr[i] should be placed in the sorted array.
 Therefore, we need to swap the element at index i with the element at its correct position.
 And if that correct index is already occupied by the element at index i, then we need to keep on swapping until we find an empty index.
 And if it is at its correct index, then we need to increment i by 1.
